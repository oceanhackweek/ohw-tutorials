## What’s This About?

This is a beginner-friendly introduction to using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** with Python —  
tailored for **ocean, climate, and environmental science** applications.  

It’s designed for researchers, data scientists, and practitioners who want to:  
- Understand how LLMs work  
- Learn how to run them efficiently  
- Build practical, domain-specific tools for science

## The Presentation Covers

- **How LLMs are trained** and what makes them powerful  
- The **difference between open-source and paid models**  
- How to **run LLMs locally** using quantized models  
- How to **build chatbots** with Python libraries like **LangChain**  
- How to **connect LLMs** to tools, datasets, and Python code  
- Examples relevant to **oceanography and climate science**
