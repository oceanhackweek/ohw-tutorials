## What’s This About?

This is a beginner-friendly introduction to using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** with Python — perfect for researchers who want to understand how these models work and how to build useful tools with them.

The presentation covers:

- How LLMs are trained and what makes them powerful
- The difference between open-source and paid models
- How to run LLMs on your laptop using quantized models
- How to build chatbots using Python libraries like **LangChain**
- How to connect LLMs to tools, data, and Python code
