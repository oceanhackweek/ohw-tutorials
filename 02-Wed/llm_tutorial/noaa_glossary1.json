Empirical studies show that a cap greater than 2°C often precludes thunderstorms in the absence of a strongdynamicalor forced lift.This occurs even when the instability is excessive. A strong cap prevents widespread convection from occurring; thus, it allows low level heat and moisture to increase over a period of time. This in turn increases the amount of potential instability.Also, the air above it can cool, which also increases potential instability. This delay in the onset of convection increases the severe potential for a limited number of cells that manage to punch through the cap or reach the boundary separating capped from uncapped region.The cap is an important ingredient in most severe thunderstorm episodes, as it serves to separate warm, moist air below and cooler, drier air above. Meanwhile, when there is no cap, either process (warming/moistening at low levels or cooling aloft) results in a faster release of available instability - often before instability levels become large enough to support severe weather development. As a result, convection tends to be widespread, but less intense.This is a result of developing thunderstorms competing for a limited amount of available moisture. Therefore, severe storms often form along these lid boundaries, where the release of potential instability is favored. As a result, thunderstorms showing rapid growth within or very near a strongly capped region become severe. This is also called alid."

CSI environments typically exhibit weak convective and inertial stability for strictly vertical or horizontal motions.However,air parcelsdisplaced along certain sloped, or \"slantwise\" trajectories may attain positive buoyancy due to a unique combination of gravitational and centrifugal forces.While convective available potential energy (CAPE) values within these environments are typically much smaller than those associated with upright convection, sufficient energies are frequently present to support the formation and maintenance of thunderstorm cells.

The value of Z is a function of the amount of radar beam energy that isback scatteredby a target and detected as a signal (or echo). Higher values of Z (and dBZ) thus indicate more energy being back scattered by a target.The amount of back scattered energy generally is related to precipitation intensity, such that higher values of dBZ that are detected from precipitation areas generally indicate higher precipitation rates. However, other factors can affect reflectivity, such as width of the radar beam, precipitation type, drop size, or the presence of ground clutter orAP.WSR-88D radars can detect reflectivities as low as -32 dBZ near the radar site, but significant (measurable) precipitation generally is indicated by reflectivities of around 15 dBZ or more.

It typically lies north-south across the central and southern high Plains states during the spring and early summer, where it separates moist air from the Gulf of Mexico (to the east) and dry desert air from the southwestern states (to the west).The dry line typically advances eastward during the afternoon and retreats westward at night. However, a strong storm system can sweep the dry line eastward into the Mississippi Valley, or even further east, regardless of the time of day. A typical dry line passage results in a sharp drop in humidity (hence the name), clearing skies, and a wind shift from south or southeasterly to west or southwesterly. (Blowing dust and rising temperatures also may follow, especially if the dry line passes during the daytime; seedry punch).The dry line's eastward movement at the surface is often not as fast as it is aloft. Dry air at about 1,000 feet (305 meters) can overrun the moist air, creating what is called a cappinginversion. Hot air over warm air acts like a lid that keeps heated air from rising. On some days this lid is very thick preventing the blossoming of storms.But on other days, the lid holds the unstable air down for only so long before it breaks through the inversion and clouds explode into thunderstorms. Storms may grow to 50,000 feet (15,200 meters) or higher in minutes as moist air rockets skyward at 100 mph (160 km/h), creating large hail, torrential rain, deadly lightning and strong winds. And with low-level winds changing speed and direction with height, from south to southwest then to west, storms are likely to rotate, which can lead to powerful tornadoes.The thunderstorms most likely to produce tornadoes are calledsupercellsand are often a product of the severe weather trigger known as the dry line. When the dry line retreats westward at night, the dew points will rise rapidly and the wind will shift from the west or southwest to the south or southeast. SeeLow Precipitation storm.

Characterized by the warming of the sea surface temperatures (SST) in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, beginning at about Christmas time (hence the name \"El Niño\", which is Spanish for \"Christ child\").This causes the sardine population to die off the Peru coast. The anomalously warm water also causes the deep convection to shift from its normal position near Indonesia to the east. This is also preceded and accompanied by anomalous westerly wind at low levels.During the warm phase of the SO severe drought occurs over Indonesia and Australia. The warming of the ocean in the tropical Pacific increases the strength of the Hadley circulation (a global wind pattern) and causes the entire tropics to warm.The strengthened hemispheric north-south temperature gradient adds energy to the atmosphere. In particular, the subtropical jet is stronger and its maximum wind extends farther to the east than is normal.This is often related to the deeper than normalAleutian low, a split jet-level flow over the western U.S. and a trough in the southeastern U.S. This pattern is called the \"Pacific North AmericanTeleconnectionpattern\".When established, it leads to warm, dry conditions over the northern U.S., particularly the Northwest, and to unusually wet conditions over the southern U.S. The El Niño typically lasts from 12 to 18 months.

      "definition": "As an integral part of its mission, the NWS recognizes the need to provide the emergency management community with access to a set of NWS warnings, watches, forecasts, and other products at no recurring cost. Toward that end, the Emergency Managers Weather Information Network (EMWIN) system was developed.In partnership with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and other public and private organizations, EMWIN is now evolving into a fully operational and supported NWS service.EMWIN is a suite of data access methods which make available a live stream of weather and other critical emergency information. Each method has unique advantages. EMWIN's present methods in use or under development for disseminating the basic datastream include:Radio- Digital weather information is transmitted using inexpensive radio broadcast and personal computer (PC) technologies. The NWS (and other public and private agencies) transmits selected text, graphics, and imagery products as an audio signal on a dedicated VHF or UHF radio frequency.This information can be received, by anyone within the 40- to 50-mile (64- to 80-kilometer) broadcast area, using an inexpensive radio receiver, a demodulator, and a personal computer. EMWIN software on your PC, running under Windows, receives the signal through a serial port, stores the received weather products onto disk, and simultaneously allows you to display this information.Internet- The Interactive Weather Information Network (IWIN) page uses HTML formatting and additional hyperlinks to an EMWIN server that ingests the data. Access to this data, as a linked series of clickable screens, is provided to clients operating web browsers such as Internet Explorer or Netscape. Graphics or text-only access is provided. FTP access is also available. The IWIN server has been online since September 1995.Satellite- Satellite broadcast makes the datastream available nationwide, but not to provide detailed support (i.e. funding, manpower, or equipment) for state and local efforts to redistribute the datastream after downlink. The NWS broadcasts EMWIN on GOES 10 and GOES 12 satellites.Note: The above methods are intended to provide data to users who currently have none or who can afford very little. Be aware that there are other methods available, at higher cost to the end-user, including various commercial weather distribution systems.EMWIN is a supplement to other NWS dissemination services, which include:NOAA Weather Radio (NWR),NOAA Weather Wire System (NWWS),Family of Services (FOS),NOAAPORT, and NEXRAD Information Dissemination Service (NIDS)."

Since both parameters are important for severe weather development, higher values generally indicate a greater potential for severe weather.Values of 1 or more are said to indicate a heightened threat of tornadoes; values of 5 or more are rarely observed, and are said to indicate potential for violent tornadoes.

Higher values of helicity (generally, around 150 m2/s2or more) favor the development of mid-level rotation (i.e. mesocyclones). Extreme values can exceed 600 m2/s2. It is dependent on the local environmental wind profile in which a thunderstorm develops and the thunderstorm motion."

The temperature difference between 850 mb and 500 mb is used to parameterize the vertical temperature lapse rate.The 850 mb dew point provides information on the moisture content of the lower atmosphere. The vertical extent of the moist layer is represented by the difference of the 700 mb temperature and 700 mbdewpoint. This is called the700 mb temperature-dew point depression.The index is derived arithmetically and does not require a plotted sounding. K-index = [(850 mb temperature - 500 mb temperature) + 850 mb dew point - 700 dew point depression]. The K-index favors non-severe convection, especially heavy rain producing convection. Threshold values vary with season, location, and synoptic situation.K-indices are also used to determine the potential of flooding.

Each cell generates a cold air outflow and these individual outflows combine to form a large gust front.Convergence along the gust front causes new cells to develop every 5 to 15 minutes. The cells move roughly with the mean wind. However, the area (storm) motion usually deviates significantly from the mean wind due to discrete propagation (new cell development) along the gust front.The multicellular nature of the storm is usually apparent on radar with multiple reflectivity cores and maximum tops.Severe multicell thunderstorms occur in environments possessing moderate verticalwind shearand moderate to large positive buoyancy (CAPE).The moderate vertical wind shear leads to the development of a non-symmetric surfaceconvergencepattern associated with the thunderstorm outflow, with the strongest convergence taking place on the downwind from the storm's motion.New cells developing along this enhanced convergence zone tend to move in the same direction as the older cells, which increases the time that the new cells will experience low-level convergence and tap into the warm, moist inflow air. Cell regeneration in the convergence zone along an outflow boundary is the primary physical mechanism for maintaining a multicell storm. Moderate to large buoyancy ensures that strong updrafts are possible.Multicell thunderstorms usually develop in an environment where the vertical wind shear is characterized by a straight-line hodograph. The name describes well what it looks like on the hodograph. TheBulk Richardson numberfor a multicellular thunderstorm environment is typically above 50.These thunderstorms can become severe producing hail greater than 1\" (2.5 cm) hail, wind gusts greater than 58 mph (93 km/h), and possibly a tornado.

Left Movers are favored when you havebacking winds.Radar will observe essentially one long-lived cell, but small perturbations to the cell structure may be evident.

ABulk Richardson Numberof between 15 and 35 favor supercell development.Typically, thehodographwill look like a horse shoe. This is due to the wind speed increasing rapidly with height and the wind direction either veering or backing rapidly with height."

Lightning frequency is not a criterion for issuing a severe thunderstorm warning. They are usually issued for a duration of one hour. They can be issued without aSevere Thunderstorm Watchbeing already in effect.Like aTornado Warning, the Severe Thunderstorm Warning is issued by your National Weather Service Forecast Office (NWFO). Severe Thunderstorm Warnings will include where the storm was located, what towns will be affected by the severe thunderstorm, and the primary threat associated with the severe thunderstorm warning.If the severe thunderstorm will affect the nearshore or coastal waters, it will be issued as the combined product--Severe Thunderstorm Warning and Special Marine Warning.If the severe thunderstorm is also causing torrential rains, this warning may also be combined with aFlash Flood Warning. After it has been issued, the issuing weather forecast office will followed up periodically withSevere Weather Statements.These statements will contain updated information on the severe thunderstorm and they will also let you know when warning is no longer in effect.

Tides are the result of the gravitational attraction of the sun and the moon on the earth.The attraction of the moon is far greater than the attraction of the sun due to the close proximity of the earth and the moon. The sun is 360 times further from the earth than the moon. Therefore, the moon plays a larger role than the sun in producing tides.Every 27.3 days, the earth and the moon revolve around a common point. This means that the oceans and other water bodies which are affected by the earth-moon system experience a new tidal cycle every 27.3 days. Because of the physical processes which occur to produce the tidal system, there are two high tides and two low tides each day.Because of the angle of the moon with respect to the earth, the two high tides each day do not have to be of equal height. The same holds true for the two low tides each day.Tides also differ in height on a daily basis. The daily differences between tidal heights is due to the changing distance between the earth and the moon. Scientists use measurements of the height of the water level to examine tides and the various phenomena which influence tides, such as hurricanes and winter storms."

It summarizes all watches or warnings in effect. It includes the location of the storm center in latitude and longitude and in distance from a well-known point. The current movement is given to 16 points of the compass.Also, included in this advisory are the maximum sustained wind, pressure, storm tide or storm surge and the radius of both hurricane force and tropical storm force winds (just tropical storm force winds for a tropical storm) and an intensity forecast. If it is going to affect land, inland effects will also be highlighted in this advisory.They are issued for all tropical storms and hurricanes in the Atlantic (which includes the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico) and central Pacific. In the eastern Pacific, they are issued for all tropical cyclones that are expected to affect land within 48 hours.They will cease to be issued when the tropical cyclone becomes extratropical (the storm no longer has tropical characteristics), drops below depression stage, or move inland over large land areas, such as the United States, Mexico, Canada, or Central America.Intermediate Public Tropical Cyclone Advisory (TCP)- Issued to ensure a more continuous flow of information to the public whenever a tropical cyclone affects a coast or is forecast to affect a coast. Intermediate advisories will not be used to issue tropical cyclone watches or warnings, but it may be used to clear all or portion of a watch or warning area.

The meteorological condition that requires the issuance of the special advisory is normally highlighted. However, since special advisories are designed to update earlier scheduled advisories, their format and content will be less rigid.Scheduled Tropical Cyclone Forecasts/Advisory (TCM)- This is one of the most prominent products issued by the hurricane centers.

They will contain generally the same information as the Tropical Cyclone Forecast/Advisory; however, their format is less stringent.Subtropical Cyclone Public Advisory (SPA)- These advisories are issued when a subtropical storm is affecting or is forecasted to affect the U.S., our territories, or our installations. Each subtropical storm is assigned a storm number to keep track of the sequence of occurrences such storms in that area. The contents of the advisory are the same as advisories on depressions; however, subtropical storms are referred to as plain \"storms\".Thus, they are entitled as storm advisories. They are issued at the same scheduled times as hurricane and tropical storm advisories. They are updated as needed for significant changes such as a change in course, a threat of tornadoes being added, or a major change in intensity. For each storm, the advisories are numbered consecutively for the life of the storm.Intermediate Subtropical Cyclone Public Advisory (SPA)- These advisories function in the same manner as public intermediate advisories. Whenever a subtropical cyclone affects or is forecasted to affect a coast, they will be issued on a 2 to 3 hourly interval between scheduled advisories. For clarity, whenever the National Hurricane Center is issuing intermediates, a statement will be included at the end of the scheduled public subtropical advisory telling the user that an intermediate advisory will be issued.Special Subtropical Cyclone Public Advisory (SPA)- These advisories are issued to update the previously scheduled advisory whenever a significant change in the cyclone has occurred. The change or conditions that require the issuance of the special advisory normally are highlighted.Scheduled Subtropical Forecast/Advisory (SMA)- These advisories are issued when a subtropical storm is affecting or is forecasted to affect the U.S., our territories, or our installations. Each subtropical storm is assigned a storm number to keep track of the sequence of occurrences such storms in that area. The contents of the advisory are the same as advisories on depressions; however, subtropical storms are referred to as plain \"storms\". Thus, they are entitled as storm advisories.

The wall cloud develops as the strong updraft draws in surface moisture from several miles away.Eventually, this updraft will pull air from the rain cooled area of the thunderstorm.

In the summer and spring, these phenomena are usually \"tornadoes over water\" that have been generated by thunderstorms.In the fall months, these most often begin ascold air funnels, being generated by a cold air mass passing over much warmer waters. Such waterspouts are generally much less intense than tornadoes and usually dissipate upon approaching shore."

Pressure that's higher at one place than another sets up a force pushing from the high toward the low pressure. The greater the difference in pressures, the stronger the force.The distance between the area of high pressure and the area of low pressure also determines how fast the moving air is accelerated. Meteorologists refer to the force that starts the wind flowing as the \"pressure gradient force.\"High and low pressure are relative. There's no set number that divides high and low pressure. Wind is used to describe the prevailing direction from which the wind is blowing with the speed given usually in miles per hour or knots.

      "term": "Wind Chill",
      "definition": "The wind chill is the effect of the wind on people and animals. The wind chill temperature is based on the rate of heat loss from exposed skin caused by wind and cold and is to give you an approximation of how cold the air feels on your body.As the wind increases, it removes heat from the body, driving down skin temperature and eventually the internal body temperature. Therefore, the wind makes it FEEL much colder. If the temperature is 0°F (-18°C) and the wind is blowing at 15 mph (24 km/h), the wind chill temperature is -19°F (-28°C). At this level, exposed skin can freeze in just a few minutes.The only effect wind chill has on inanimate objects, such as car radiators and water pipes, is to shorten the amount of time for the object to cool. The inanimate object will not cool below the actual air temperature. For example, if the temperature outside is -5°F (-21°C) and the wind chill temperature is -31°F (-35°C), then your car's radiator temperature will be no lower than the air temperature of -5°F (-21°C)."
